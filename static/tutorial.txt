AVL Tree
+ What is an AVL tree?
    - What is a tree?
        = A tree is a kind of data structure.
        = Trees are a collection of nodes.
            # Nodes have a key and a value associated with them.
            # They can also have child nodes, or nodes on the level below that they are connected to.
        = It's shaped like an upside down tree, or like tree roots, hence the name.
        = We call the first node at the top the "root."
        = We call a node without any children a "leaf" node.
        = What is depth? What is height?
            # Depth and height are important concepts of trees.
            # Depth is the number of steps away from the root node a node is.
            # Height is the maximum number of steps from a node to its leaf nodes.
        = What are traversals?
        = An example of a tree:
              C
           / / \ \
          D A   F G
          |      / \
          B     E   H
        = In the above example, node G has a depth of 1 and a height of 1.
        Node B has a depth of 2 and a height of 0. Node C has a depth of 0 and a height of 2.
        = What information can we get from a tree? What operations can we perform?
            # Get the number of nodes in the tree (its size)
            # Get the value associated with a node's key
            # Get the height of the tree
            # Get the maximum and minimum key in the tree
            # Get the traversals for the tree

            # Check if the tree has a node with a specific key
            # Insert a new node into the tree
            # Update an existing node's value
            # Remove a node with a specific key from the tree
    - What is a binary tree?
        = A binary tree is a tree in which each node is allowed at most two children.
        = An example of a binary tree:
              C
            /   \
           D     A
          / \     \
         F   G     E
              \     \
               B     H
    - What is a binary search tree?
        = A binary search tree is a binary tree that has three properties. For any node:
            1. The left subtree of the node only has nodes with keys less than the node's key.
            2. The right subtree of the node only has nodes with keys more than the node's key.
            3. The left and right subtree of the node must also be binary search trees.
        = An example of a binary search tree:
              D
            /   \
           B     F
          / \     \
         A   C     G
              \     \
               E     H
    - What is a self balancing binary search tree?
        = A self-balancing binary search tree is a binary search tree that performs some operation on itself
        when it becomes unbalanced.
        = What is balance?
            # Balance is the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of a node.
    - Who made AVL trees?
        = AVL trees were invented by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis.
        = AVL trees were the first kind of self-balancing binary search tree.
    - How does it differ from a Binary Search Tree?
        = An AVL tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree that performs rotations on nodes when
        it becomes unbalanced.
        =
        = What can BSTs do? How do AVL trees modify/add to this?
- What is balance?
    - What is height?
    - What are the four ways in which a tree can be unbalanced?
- What are rotations?
    - What are the two types of rotation?
- When do we use rotations?
    - How do we use rotations to balance a tree?
