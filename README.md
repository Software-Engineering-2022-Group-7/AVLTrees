## Introduction to AVL Trees through Visualization

###### This repository contains the design of a website that teaches users AVL Tree data structure.

### How we organized the repository:
The repository is built on flask. The template folder contains the Html files, 
and the static folder contains CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant files. 
app.py will run flask and return an url for our website.

### There are five sections in our website:
* A home page that describes the purpose of each section
* A tutorial that introduces AVL Trees
* A Html canvas on which AVL visualization is displayed
* Actual implementations of AVL Trees
* A short quiz on AVL Trees

### Official URL
The public accessible url will be published soon and be displayed here.
