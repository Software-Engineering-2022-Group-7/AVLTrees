## Introduction to AVL Trees through Visualization

_This repository contains the design of a website that teaches users about the AVL tree data structure._

### How we organized the repository:
The repository is built on Flask. The template folder contains the HTML files, 
and the static folder contains CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant files.

app.py will run Flask and return a temporary URL for our website.

### There are five sections in our website:
* A home page that describes the purpose of each section
* A tutorial that introduces and provides background information on AVL trees 
* An implementation of the AVL tree data structure in JavaScript with explanations
* An animated AVL tree visualization tool
* A conceptual quiz on AVL trees

### Official URL
Here is the URL for our website: [IntroToAvl](https://introtoavl.pythonanywhere.com/)
