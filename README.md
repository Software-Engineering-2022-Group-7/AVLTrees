## Introduction to AVL Trees through Visualization

_This repository contains the design of a website that teaches users AVL Tree data structure._

### How we organized the repository:
The repository is built on Flask. The template folder contains the HTML files, 
and the static folder contains CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant files. 
app.py will run flask and return an url for our website.

### There are five sections in our website:
* A home page that describes the purpose of each section
* A tutorial that introduces and provides background information on AVL trees 
* An implementation of the AVL tree data structure in JavaScript with explanations
* An animated AVL tree visualization tool
* A conceptual quiz on AVL trees

### Official URL
The public accessible url will be published soon and be displayed here.
